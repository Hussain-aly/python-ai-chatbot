This project features a basic text-based AI chatbot developed in Python. It was created to explore fundamental natural language processing (NLP) concepts and build a simple conversational agent capable of understanding and responding to predefined phrases.

How it Works
The chatbot listens for specific keywords or phrases (e.g., greetings, farewells). If a recognized phrase is detected, it responds with a predefined, often randomized, reply. If the input is not understood, it provides a general "I didn't understand that" message.

Key Features
Handles common greetings and farewells with appropriate responses.

Provides a fallback message for unrecognized user input, demonstrating basic error handling.

Engages in simple, interactive text-based conversations.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

random module: Used to select varied responses for a more natural conversational flow.

Conditional Logic (if/elif/else): Essential for matching user input to predefined patterns and triggering appropriate responses.

Loops: Used to maintain a continuous conversation flow, allowing the user to interact multiple times.

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Hussain-aly/python-ai-chatbot.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd python-ai-chatbot

Run the chatbot:

python python-ai-chatbot.py

My Role
This chatbot was developed independently as a solo project.
